# URL Shortener

This project is to help me know how to work with Active Record. It's going to have a CLI. You give it a URL of arbitrary length and it shortens it. It can also track clicks on the URL. Should be fun!

Note, it's not production-ready. It's a toy app. 

To run the app, clone, cd into cloned directory, and type `rails runner bin/cli` in the command line.
